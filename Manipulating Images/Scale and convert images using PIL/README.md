### Problem Statement
write a script that processes a bunch of images. It turns out that your company is in the process of updating its website, and a design contractor has been hired to create some new icon graphics for the site. However, the contractor has delivered the final designs and they’re in the wrong format, rotated 90° and too large. You’re unable to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch!

You'll need to go through a folder full of images and operate with each of them. On each image, you'll use PIL methods like the ones we saw in the examples, and then write the new images in the right place.


### Introduction
Your company is in the process of updating its website, and they’ve hired a design contractor to create some new icon graphics for the site.
But the contractor has delivered the final designs in the wrong format -- rotated 90° and too large. Oof! You’re not able to get in contact with the designers and your own deadline is approaching fast. 
You’ll need to use Python to get these images ready for launch.

### What you’ll do
Use the Python Imaging Library to do the following to a batch of images:
 1. Open an image
 2. Rotate an image
 3. Resize an image
 4. Save an image in a specific format in a separate directory
