You have modified the fruit images through changeImage.py script. Now, you will have to upload these modified images to the web server that is handling the fruit catalog. To do that, you'll have to use the Python requests module to send the file contents to the [linux-instance-IP-Address]/upload URL.

Copy the external IP address of your instance from the Connection Details Panel on the left side and enter the IP address in a new web browser tab. This opens a web page displaying the text "Fruit Catalog".

In the home directory, you'll have a script named example_upload.py to upload images to the running fruit catalog web server. To view the example_upload.py script use the cat command.
